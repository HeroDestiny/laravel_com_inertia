# Docker Security Improvements

## Security Changes Made

### 1. Non-Root User Implementation
- Created a dedicated `appuser` (UID 1000) and `appgroup` (GID 1000) for running application services
- All application services (nginx, php-fpm) now run as the non-root `appuser`
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks and limits potential damage from container escape

### 2. Port Configuration
- Changed nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of port 80
- Non-root users cannot bind to privileged ports (< 1024)
- This is a standard security practice for containerized applications

### 3. File Permissions
- Proper ownership and permissions set for all application directories
- Application files owned by `appuser:appgroup`
- Storage and cache directories have appropriate write permissions

### 4. Service Isolation
- Supervisor runs as root but spawns services as `appuser`
- Each service (nginx, php-fpm) explicitly configured to run as `appuser`
- Provides proper process isolation and security boundaries

### 5. Directory Structure
- Created dedicated log directories with proper permissions
- Nginx temporary directories properly configured for non-root operation
- All runtime directories accessible to the application user

## Security Benefits

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Services run with minimal required permissions
2. **Attack Surface Reduction**: Eliminated root access for application services
3. **Container Security**: Follows Docker security best practices
4. **Process Isolation**: Clear separation between system and application processes

## Usage Notes

- The container still starts as root for initial setup (file permissions, directory creation)
- Application services immediately drop to non-root user through supervisor
- Port 8080 should be mapped to host port 80 in docker-compose or deployment configuration
- All Laravel operations (migrations, cache operations) run as the application user

## Example Docker Compose Update

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:8080"  # Map host port 80 to container port 8080
    # ... other configuration
```

This approach maintains security while ensuring all necessary operations can be performed during container startup.
